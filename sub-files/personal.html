                                        Meg was born and raised in a small town outside of Boston, Massachusetts, where she learned about computers at a young age from her Grandfather. He used programming languages for most of his career as an Actuary and was fond of teaching, which allowed Meg and her siblings to learn at early ages about E-Mail, AOL, and even how to take a computer apart and put it back together. Meg has always been intrigued by technology, but didn't start coding until she was about 14 years old. At this age, Meg was comfortable with computers and internet was new, so she became very familiar with social media including LiveJournal and MySpace. Aesthetics have always been important to Meg, as is learning what makes her sites tick. Every day her site would look different because she enjoyed coding and making her site look "pretty".

                                    <p>
                                        Since her early teens, Meg earned her Bachelor of Science Degree from Westfield State University in Environmental Science, Regional Planning, and Geographic Information Systems. After graduation in 2011, she relocated to Nashville, Tn., where she was presented with an abudance of opportunities including publishing, engineering, volunteer management and software development. She is currently enrolled in a full-time advanced UX UI Front-End Development program at Nashville Software School.
